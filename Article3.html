            <pre style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 20px;">    OpenAI has announced on social media X that ChatGPT users can now browse the internet to access 
up-to-date information. The feature called ‘Browse with Bing’ is available to ‘Plus’ and ‘Enterprise’ paid 
users. OpenAI plans to make it available to all other users later. The browsing feature will also allow 
websites to control how ChatGPT can interact with them. Previously, the generative AI (GenAI) model was 
trained using data up to September 2021. The new update will allow ChatGPT to move beyond the cutoff date to 
provide current information available on the Web.</pre>
